            <h2>üßë‚Äçüíª About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I‚Äôm Tharun ‚Äî an engineering student with a growing passion for web development and a deep curiosity for how things work behind the scenes of the digital world. Ever since I began exploring technology, I‚Äôve found joy in building things that not only function but also feel intuitive, visually clean, and user-focused.</p>
            <p>My journey into web development started with simple HTML pages and CSS experiments, but it quickly became something more meaningful. The idea that I could bring ideas to life using just a keyboard and some code fascinated me. What began as curiosity soon turned into consistent effort, learning, and hands-on experimentation. Whether it's designing the layout of a personal portfolio, styling a page to perfection, or adding functionality with JavaScript and React, I‚Äôve come to enjoy each part of the process.</p>
            <p>What truly motivates me is the ability to create something from scratch ‚Äî to start with a blank screen and turn it into something functional, creative, and useful. I'm not just interested in writing code that works; I care about writing code that‚Äôs readable, scalable, and built with purpose.</p>
            <p>Beyond the technical side, I see myself as someone who‚Äôs always willing to learn and grow. I believe in the power of taking small, consistent steps. I don‚Äôt rush the process ‚Äî I enjoy it. Whether I succeed or fail, I try to reflect, improve, and move forward. I‚Äôve learned that growth in this field isn‚Äôt just about memorizing syntax, but about developing the mindset to solve problems, to ask why things work a certain way, and to keep learning no matter what stage you‚Äôre at.</p>
            <p>Outside of coding, I‚Äôm someone who values simplicity, creativity, and self-discipline. I enjoy exploring design, user experience, and the little details that make an interface feel alive. I also appreciate quiet moments where I can sketch ideas, organize my thoughts, or work on projects that challenge me to step out of my comfort zone.</p>
            <p>In the long run, I hope to become a full-stack developer who can confidently build complete applications ‚Äî from front-end UI to back-end logic. But for now, I'm focused on building my foundation, working on meaningful projects, and collaborating when I can. Every line of code, every bug, and every solution is a step in the journey.</p>
            <p>This portfolio is more than just a collection of projects ‚Äî it‚Äôs a reflection of where I started, what I‚Äôve learned, and where I hope to go. Thank you for visiting my page. Whether you‚Äôre a fellow developer, a recruiter, or just a curious visitor, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here.</p>
            <p>Feel free to connect with me ‚Äî I‚Äôm always open to feedback, collaboration, or just a friendly chat about tech!</p>
